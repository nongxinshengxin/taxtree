\title{Construct their categorised topology from the list of node names.}
\usage{
make_Taxtree(file, header = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{the name of the file which the data are to be read from.This file contains the names of all the nodes for which you want to build a classification topology. Each line is a separate node name.}
\item{header}{a logical value indicating whether the file contains the names of the variables as its first line. If missing, the value is determined from the file format: header is set to TRUE if and only if the first row contains one fewer field than the number of columns. Default is FALSE}
}
\description{
If you have some definite node names (either Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Genus Species or any other taxonomic node), you can use this function to construct their taxonomic topology from a list of node names.
