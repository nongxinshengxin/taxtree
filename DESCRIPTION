Title: an R package for generating a topology of species evolutionary relationships based on the Taxonomy database
Version: 0.1.0

Description: The Taxonomy Database is a curated classification and nomenclature
    for all of the organisms in the public sequence databases.
    This currently represents about 10% of the described species of life on the planet. 
    The official address for the NCBI Taxonomy database is 
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy 
    and the public data download address is 
    https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/.
    `taxtree` is used to generate a topology of species 
    evolutionary relationships based on the Taxonomy database by 
    processing `names.dmp` and `nodes.dmp` and drawing simple 
    evolutionary trees based on the hierarchy of species classification.
    The implementation of `taxtree` function relies on `tidyverse` and `ggtree`.
